# CIST4B1_AdvJava
A repository to document my Java learning journey

ABOUT ME: Hi Everyone, my name is Malik Goodlow!I was born in North Carolina and raised in the east bay. I am a SJSU student and should be graduating this upcoming year. I am currently a Data Structures using Advanced Java student. This class is preparation for my Forensic Science Digital Evidence major. My background in code spans over the last couple years with Python being my first language that introduced me to the field. I now have experience in Java and with data extraction tools like SQLite, Axiom, and Autopsy. My ideal career goal is to be a digital forensic examiner, however would love to start in Data Analytics. 

Goals for this course: Hopefully with the knowledge gained in this course and beyond I can make my goals happen. To leverage this course for a career in softwar, my primary goal should be to master the implementation and analysis of core data structures and algorithms to confidently navigate technical coding interviews. Simultaneously, aim to develop the architectural intuition to select the most efficient tools for solving real-world problems, transitioning from simply writing code to designing scalable, high-performance systems.
